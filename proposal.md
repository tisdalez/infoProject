## Data and Audience
[data](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)


The dataset we will be working with is the Seattle Police Department Crime Data, the data was collected by the Seattle Police department, and it was accessed through the Government of Seattle website. The data is refreshed everyday, so we will be able to get very recent data. According to the Seattle Government website 
“The Seattle Police Department (SPD) replaced its Records Management System (RMS) in May 2019. To preserve data quality and continuity between systems (2008-Present), SPD relied on the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The standardization of crime classifications allows for comparison over time. For more information on definitions and classifications, please visit https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/nibrs.”


Our target audience for the data set is the citizens of Seattle, anyone possibly interested in visiting Seattle, as well as people who live in cities like Seattle, as crime isn’t unique to Seattle. We hope our audience would learn more about the crime that occurs in this area such as the most common types of crime in Seattle, the most common areas where crime occurs, and what time of day most crime occurs among others.

## Technical Description

We will be reading the data as a .csv file, we have put it into R, and have had no problems so far with reading the data, so at this point we are not reshaping or reformatting the data. Also because we have had no problems, we are not currently planning on using any major or new libraries that haven’t been discussed or used in projects.

## Project Set-up


To do
- How to upload a data set into git? -Zack
- Will the data be updated as we go on, as spd releases new crime statistics daily?- Zack
- When working on the project, will we have multiple people working on a document at a time -   or how will we communicate who is working on what at what time? (Ray)
- How to use Pull in Git to make sure that you’re up to date? (marcus)
- What format will we use to commit to git, as in “version 1.0” or “finished adding areas to   crime analysis” ? (Marcus)
